# Sampling Analysis using DNA

In this repo, we provide a set of scripts that allow for the analysis of dynamic graphs generated by sampling a given network with [DNA (Dynamic Network Analyzer)](http://github.com/BenjaminSchiller/DNA).

These analyses include an attempt to find the best solution for the MCNC (Maximum Connected Netwrork Coverage) problem, determine properties of sampled graphs as they grow, understand the impact of parameters on the sampling performance, and visualizations of sampled graphs while growing.

## Java Code

The java code used for the execution can be found in the `java/` directory.
The three main execution classes (`Analysis.java`, `Plot.java`, and `Visualization.java`) are all located in the package `dna.sampling`.

## Ant Build File

To build jars for the three main Java classes (`analysis.jar`, `plot.jar`, and `vis.jar`), an ant build file is provided in `analysis/build.xml`.

## Bash Scripts

In `analysis/`, we provide a set of bash scripts that can be used for performing the afforementioned analyses and generate html files for displaying the results.

### Execution

For the execution of analysis and the following plotting, we use the [JOBS scripts](https://github.com/BenjaminSchiller/jobs).

	analysis.sh
Performing the analyses using `analysis.jar`.

	plot.sh
Combining the results of multiple sampling algorithms into single plots using `plot-jar`.

	vis.sh
Generation of animated gifs while sampling a given graph using `vis.jar`.

### HTML Generation

	html-analysis.sh
Generation of html/php files for the analysis results.
Here, the results from a "category" are grouped into a single page to allow for an easy comparison.

	html-vis.sh
Generation of html/php files for the visualization results.
For each sampled graph, a separate html/php page is generated displaying a visualization for each sampling algorithm.

## Results

A set of these results, including the generated html files can be found on [dynamic-networks.org](http://dynamic-networks.org/use_cases/sampling/).
